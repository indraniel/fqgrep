SYNOPSIS
========

'fqgrep' is an approximate sequence pattern matcher for FASTQ/FASTA files.
One can think of it as being a grep (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep)
and agrep (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrep) like tool optimized
for FASTQ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) and FASTA
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) files. It can work directly
on both compressed and uncompressed file types.

Below is the help message via ('fqgrep -h') describing its usage:

Usage: fqgrep [options] -p <pattern> <fastq_or_fasta_files>
        -h                  This help message
        -V                  Program and version information
        -p <STRING>         Pattern of interest to grep [REQUIRED]
        -v                  Invert match - show only sequences that
                            DO NOT match the pattern
        -a                  Show all records irregardless of match status
                            Useful in conjunction with the -r option;
                            when one would like to do further post-processing
                            of the match data
        -c                  Highlight matching string with color

        -b <STRING>         Delimiter string to separate columns
                            in detailed stats report [Default: '\t']
        -m <INT>            Total number of mismatches to at most allow for
                            in search pattern [Default: 0]
        -s <INT>            Max threshold of substitution mismatches to allow
                            for in search pattern [Default: unlimited]
        -i <INT>            Max threshold of insertion mismatches to allow for
                            in search pattern [Default: unlimited]
        -d <INT>            Max threshold of deletion mismatches to allow for
                            in search pattern [Default: unlimited]
        -S <INT>            Cost of base substitutions in obtaining
                            approximate match [Default: 1]
        -I <INT>            Cost of base insertions in obtaining
                            approximate match [Default: 1]
        -D <INT>            Cost of base deletions in obtaining
                            approximate match [Default: 1]
        -e                  Force tre regexp engine usage
        -C                  Display only a total count of matches
                            (per input FASTQ/FASTA file)
        -o <out_file>       Desired output file.
                            If not specified, defaults to stdout

PREREQUISITES
=============

"fqgrep" depends upon the following libraries:

  * TRE Regular Expression Library (TRE)
    [http://laurikari.net/tre/] version 0.8.0.
  * zlib
    [http://www.zlib.net]

They will need to be available on your system before fqgrep can be
installed.

    TRE
    ===

        On Ubuntu (or any other Debian-based Linux distribution):
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        
            sudo apt-get install libtre-dev libtre5

        On Mac OS X 
        -----------
    
        via macports [http://www.macports.org/] :
    
            sudo port install tre
    
        or via homebrew [http://brew.sh] :
    
            brew install tre
    
        or via compiling direct source code:
    
            wget http://laurikari.net/tre/tre-0.8.0.tar.gz
            tar -zxvf tre-0.8.0.tar.gz
            cd tre-0.8.0
            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install
    
        Other Alternative Operating Systems
        -----------------------------------
        
        For other installation alternatives please visit the following web site:
    
            http://laurikari.net/tre/download/
    
    zlib
    ====

    On Ubuntu (or any other Debian-based Linux distribution):

        sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev

Usage of the example trimmer, fqgrep-trim.pl, provided in the scripts
subdirectory of this git repository, may require the installation of the
'Path::Class' perl module (found on CPAN) onto your system.

As the root user, please try the following terminal command for
"Path::Class" installation:

     cpan Path::Class

INSTALLATION
============

The installation process currently consists of a very simple Makefile.

Just do the following:

git clone git://github.com/indraniel/fqgrep.git;
cd fqgrep;
make; # try 'make genome'   if at the Genome Center at Washington University
      #                     or would like to create an executable with all the
      #                     relevant libraries statically compiled into it
      #
      # try 'make macports' if installing on Mac OS X and you installed the
      #                     TRE library via macports (http://www.macports.org/)

The 'fqgrep' executable should be in the working directory.
Afterwards, you can move the executable to wherever you wish.
Usually, this is the directory "/usr/local/bin" .
